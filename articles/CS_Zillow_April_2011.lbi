<p>The Case Shiller Home Price Indexes were published last week and it's time to look inside the data at Dallas-Fort Worth's index level as of April. (The index is published two months in arears.) </p>
<p>This month I am not including the &quot;seasonally adjusted&quot; data. On it's surface I never really believed it was relevant and said so before. Seasonally adjusted is most often associated with using annualizing one month's data for comparison to a series of monthly readings. Especially in the case of Case Shiller (pun intended) where the data is a look at month over month data, it seemed a mistaken application of the concept. I did some more research and the result -- RIP &quot;seasonally adjusted&quot; price index.</p>
<p>Also this month, I am have made an index of the Zillow median home price for Dallas-Fort Worth and plotted it along with the Case Shiller unadjusted index. Now we have the results of two methods to look at -- <ol >
<li>Case Shiller, where repeat sales of the same home are compared through a complex method; and </li>
<li>Zillow, where the all the home prices are estimated (zestimated) monthly through a complex process and the median value reported. Keeping apples-to-apples  I use Zillow's DFW number.</li></ol>
In either case declines appear to have slowed, a bottom may be forming. I report in another article that east Dallas MLS sales for June continue the 2011 trend as the slowest in 5 years, not by a much as other months.  Listings continue to exceed sales. (<a href="http://bit.ly/plDEdx">See the east Dallas area 12 MLS sales trends</a>.) The apparent settling of prices may indicate price levels are now in line with demand, a bottom may be forming.
