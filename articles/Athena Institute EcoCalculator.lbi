<h1>Nice Tool - LifeCycle Carbon Footprint Calculator</h1>
<p>I saw this promoted on the APA site and clicked through to get the calculator.  It appears we should be using zone 3 for Dallas, which is the same zone for Atlanta according to the appropriate map.  (On the state maps at www.energycodes.gove/training/pdfs Dallas is zone 5 (H), for which a version is not directly available.)  I downloaded the Atlanta version, and the zone 3 version.  Note that (H) Hot and humid counties are exempt from vapor retarder requirements.  I'm also a proponent of controlled air changes which is a second method to control indoor water vapor.</p>

<h3>Website Highlights – Residential EcoCalculator Unveiled for Carbon Challenge</h3>
<div> <img src="http://www.apawood.org/images/b_images/EcoCalculator.jpg" alt="" width="185" height="66" align="left">APA’s   Carbon Challenge 2010 Design Competition is challenging designers in   Florida to design a house with the lowest carbon footprint. To aid   residential designers in determining the carbon footprint of a home, APA   worked with the Athena Institute to develop the ATHENA® EcoCalculator   for Residential Assemblies, a free software tool that uses life cycle   assessment (LCA) methodology to calculate the environmental impact of   design choices for commonly used building structure and envelope   assemblies.
