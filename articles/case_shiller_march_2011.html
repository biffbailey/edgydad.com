<p>Don't shoot the messenger.  I've been cautiously optimistic home prices are forming a bottom. I still am, prices still could be forming a bottom, but Standard and Poor's Case Shiller data for March, 2011 make me less certain.  On the upside, prices are still above the lows set in late 2008 and fall 2010.  On the downside the March data is a reversal of the unadjusted trend and acceleration of the fall in the adjusted price index.</p>
<p>Is it as bad for Dallas as Standard and Poor's David Blitzer says (as quoted by DMN's Steve Brown):   “There has been no recovery or even stabilization in home prices during or after the recent recession,” he said. “Home prices continue on their downward spiral with no relief in sight.” Maybe not. Dallas' index is still above 2008 lows.</p>
<p>I follow east Dallas MLS sales data. <a href="http://www.edgydad.com/article.php?id_article=100034">Click here to see the chart here.</a> Monthly sales for May were the lowest May total in 5 years. Every month in 2011 has been the same except one. YTD east Dallas sales are down 16% and listings are UP 7%. </p>
<p>Where did all the buyers go?  Some of them don't have jobs or earn less, sometimes a lot less, than they did in 2008. Some are struggling to hang onto the home they own. Some are trapped in negative equity. Some can't come up with a real down payment. Some can't get financing because of credit scoring. Some fear further declines in prices. And, some, more and more these days, just don't want to own homes.</p>
<p>Whatever, the &quot;buyers market&quot; is on a real roll right now.</p>
<p>Here is a chart of the unadjusted price index for Dallas:</p>
