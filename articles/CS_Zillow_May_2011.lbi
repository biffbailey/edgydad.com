<p>It's time again to look inside the Case Shiller and Zillow home price data at Dallas-Fort Worth as of May, 2011. (The index is published two months in arears.) </p>
<p>I don't use the &quot;seasonally adjusted&quot; data from Case Shiller --  I think it's a concept gone wrong.</p>
<p>This is the second month that I include the Zillow median home price for Dallas-Fort Worth metro and plotted it along with the Case Shiller unadjusted index. Now we have the results of two methods to look at -- <ol >
<li>Case Shiller, where repeat sales of the same home are compared through a complex method; and </li>
<li>Zillow, where the all the home prices are estimated (zestimated) monthly through a complex process and the median value reported. Keeping apples-to-apples  I use Zillow's DFW metro number off the national data summary.</li></ol>
Both indexes confirm the trend of slowing declines since November 2010 and, now, two consecutive months of increases. I'm looking for a June / July peak in Case Shiller's index with some softness into the start of school and subsequently the holidays. Baring further economic turmoil, I look for fairly stable price into 2012. I report in another article that east Dallas MLS sales for June continue the 2011 trend as the slowest in 5 years, not by a much as other months.  Listings continue to exceed sales. (<a href="http://bit.ly/plDEdx">See the east Dallas area 12 MLS sales trends</a>.) The apparent settling of prices continues to indicate price levels are now in line with demand, a bottom is forming.
