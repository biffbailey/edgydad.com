<p>Tax rules allow him to work for only three days of a 11-day trip and   write off the airfare and a majority of other costs, he says. "To deduct   the airfare, you have to spend more than half your working days on   business, but travel days don't count, and neither do weekend days you   wouldn't work anyway," says Mr. Stives. "So I can leave on a Friday,   teach for three days midweek, and return the following Monday."</p>
<p>His wife usually flies free using his frequent-flier miles, which are tax free.</p>
<p>Having   his own business also allows Mr. Stives to bolster his retirement fund.   As the older owner of a one-person defined-benefit pension plan, he can   put in almost 100% of his pretax self-employment income a year on top   of his Monmouth 401(k). For the 2010 tax year he will probably put in   80%, he says.</p>

<p>Mr.   Stives hired his wife for office support in part to qualify for an   IRS-allowed Health Reimbursement Arrangement that covers out-of-pocket   medical expenses with pretax dollars. He deducts her pay -- $300 per   month for part-time work -- and half her payroll taxes on his Schedule C   as well.</p>
<p>Then there are the flurry of tiny deductions that add   up. He writes off allowable mileage and food expenses on business trips.   He claims a home office, cellphone, his computer (a percentage),   professional dues and subscriptions to publications.</p>
<p>Mr. Stives   says he is careful to observe IRS rules. He has a contract for each   speaking gig, and keeps one for his wife's arrangement, too. He uses one   credit card for business expenses, making sure it provides a year-end   summary by category.</p>
<p>Most zealously, he hews to the IRS's gold   standard of "contemporaneous record-keeping" by noting expenses on his   Outlook calendar soon after they occur. He saves all receipts, putting   them in a milk crate in chronological order in case the IRS comes   calling, although he says his personal return has never been audited.</p>
