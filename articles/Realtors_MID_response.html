<p>Realtors,</p>
<p>Now is a time for thoughtful, unselfish actions.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now  is not a time for more of the past decade’s politics of the wallet, excess and  government subsidies that resulted in overbuilding and overconsumption&nbsp; of  housing resources.&nbsp; </p>
<p>It is time for defenders of free markets to live up to their  rhetoric and, among other things, be willing to accept the free market’s  determinations regarding housing demands and real estate finance.&nbsp; </p>
<p>As Realtors, our job is to remain knowledgeable professionals, ready  and able to assist buyers and sellers under any conditions.</p>
<p>So I say to fellow realtors: “Shut up, sit down.&nbsp; Be at  peace and accept the greater judgment as to what must be done to return to  financial stability as a nation.&nbsp; Know that there will not be any less  real estate, families and businesses in need of housing.&nbsp; Nimble realtors  will always be busy.”</p>
<p>I am also a professional builder and member of NAHB.&nbsp; I  have responded to NAHB’s alarm about MID with similar comments.</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>

                              <p>Last week, I called on REALTORS® to flood the House of            Representatives with calls to clearly and emphatically            communicate&nbsp;that the Mortgage Interest Deduction (MID) is vital            to both home ownership and our economy. <br />
                                I'm disappointed that anyone in Congress would suggest limits to            the Mortgage Interest Deduction. Mortgage interest has been            deductible for nearly 100 years, and the proposed changes in the            Deficit Commission Report will affect all 75 million home owners in            the United States. <br />
                                The calls we made to Capitol Hill last week made a difference.<strong> Because the calls&nbsp;to            the House&nbsp;were so successful, we are asking you to also make            calls to your Senator's office today to ask him or her to defend MID.</strong><br />
                                <img border="0" width="17" height="17" id="_x0000_i1028" src="http://www2.realtoractioncenter.com/images/content/pagebuilder/10970.gif" alt="nav_red_arrow.gif" />&nbsp;<a href="http://www2.realtoractioncenter.com/site/R?i=kt88ahOiSN3rtJNGiJyUtQ.."><strong>Call Now.*</strong></a><br />
                                This Call for Action requires you to do something a little            different. Just follow the link and enter your email, cell number and            zip code to be connected to your Senator's office. After the first            call is complete, you will be given the option to place a call to            your second Senator. You can make these calls now, or later at a more            convenient time. But we need you to make these calls.<br />
                                After you enter the information, you will receive a phone call            with instructions before being patched through to Capitol Hill.&nbsp;<br />
                                <img border="0" width="17" height="17" id="_x0000_i1029" src="http://www2.realtoractioncenter.com/images/content/pagebuilder/10970.gif" alt="nav_red_arrow.gif" />&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://www2.realtoractioncenter.com/site/R?i=P9t4hJ4GVVKydwDLtx5oOQ..">Count            me in, Ron,&nbsp;I am ready to make my call.*</a></strong><br />
                                This call is important.&nbsp;We            need to be clear and draw a line in the sand. While we all support            efforts to reduce the deficit, further undermining the critical            housing recovery cannot be the price that is paid.&nbsp;Here are some            suggested talking points for you to use when you call. I also invite            you to <a href="http://www2.realtoractioncenter.com/site/R?i=GZi2ifyzIjMWHnWJe8lqJA..">listen            to my latest podcast</a> about our efforts and why this fight is so            critical. It might give you some additional inspiration!<br />

I can assure you            that even talk of changing MID harms an already fragile market.<br />
                                <img border="0" id="_x0000_i1032" src="http://www.realtoractioncenter.com/assets/design/images/bullets/arrow-gray.gif" />&nbsp;I            am strongly opposed to the Deficit Commission's proposal to either            limit or eliminate the Mortgage Interest Deduction.<br />
                                <img border="0" id="_x0000_i1033" src="http://www.realtoractioncenter.com/assets/design/images/bullets/arrow-gray.gif" />&nbsp;News            reports saying that Congress threatens to repeal or limit MID will            keep potential buyers on the sidelines and further delay the housing            recovery.<br />
                                We must speak loudly and clearly with one voice to ensure the            further recovery of our economy and&nbsp;the housing market            and&nbsp;educate every legislator about how much&nbsp;Home Ownership            Matters.&nbsp;We can't do that with the few REALTORS® who            take action consistently. We need every REALTOR® to            respond.&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://www2.realtoractioncenter.com/site/R?i=LAMMmCOoWSPTtVFrC8XNAg.." target="_blank">Please call NOW and tell your&nbsp;Senators to help            defend home ownership and the MID.*</a></strong><br />
