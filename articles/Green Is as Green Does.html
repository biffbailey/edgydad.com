<h2 id=tagline>Green Is as Green Does</h2>
  
   
  <p>People think it's strange when you act green.&nbsp;Whole foods, paper bags and hybrid SUVs are mainstream.&nbsp; Today I decided the rains were light enough and I felt good enough to leave the car in the driveway, hook the trailer on the bike and take Sam to school.&nbsp; So what it's a little cool and rainy, the work keeps you warm, skin in waterproof and I have this nice hooded foul weather jacket, anyway.</p>

  <p>It's a 20 minute ride through my neighborhood and the next one north.&nbsp; I get the the school and pulled up under the porte-o-coche is a friend's mini-van.&nbsp; Idling.&nbsp; Wife behind the wheel.&nbsp; Husband inside dropping the kiddo.&nbsp; &quot;You're crazy!&quot; she yells.&nbsp;Am I?</p>

  <p>Got home worked on two listings and read up on scripting and value propositions.&nbsp; After lunch, I biked over to my associated broker's office to pick up an agreement using the new trail.&nbsp;Overheated a bit and there was a bit of off-road as the City hasn't quite finished the trail connections.&nbsp;Even if they do, I'm not sure I'm going to cross over the road and ride an extra three-quarter mile just to stay on the paved trail.&nbsp;It's a commute -- short and direct is what I'm after here.</p>

  <p>Anyway, I got back in time to hook up the trailer and go get Sam.&nbsp; It's fifteen minutes, one big hill and a north wind.&nbsp; The rain is mostly cleared and it's warm enough I've switched to a light windbreaker.&nbsp; Fun ride.&nbsp; At the school I see the husband.&nbsp; &quot;You're way too hard core!&nbsp; I mean I haven't ridden in a long time, let alone in the rain....&quot;&nbsp; Really -- too hard core?</p>

  <p>We stop at 7-eleven for a cookie on the way back.&nbsp; Nice day in all.&nbsp;Got some things done. But it's eating at me.&nbsp; Am I crazy?&nbsp; Too hard core?&nbsp; Is it unacceptably out-of-step to take the extra time and make the extra effort to knock out some business and personal commuting on a bicycle?</p>

  <p>More on this later.&nbsp; But, for now, I think no, it's not crazy, it's not hard core, it is an acceptable choice. I thinking about how people bike in Amsterdam and Copenhagen and Munich other places I've been.&nbsp; I think Green Is as Green Does!&nbsp; I think more folks choosing to do green as opposed to buy green is change for the better!&nbsp; </p>

  <p>ON the other hand, maybe someone with a 9,000 pound hybrid personal bus can buy some credits from me?</p>

  <p>Thanks for reading,</p>
