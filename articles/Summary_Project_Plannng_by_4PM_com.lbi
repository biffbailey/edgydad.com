<h2>Project Planning in Practice</h2>
<p>In many organizations, project planning is a combination of vague generalities in terms of the objective of the project and a rock solid completion date. That is often the only measurable project result that is quantified. Because project managers don't know what the executives want them to deliver, they have no ability to exercise control on the scope of the project and the objectives change weekly. Project team member assignments are vague and are also ever-changing which is why estimating is so inaccurate and why 70% of projects planned this way fail.</p>
<h2>Project Planning "Best Practices" In the Real World</h2>
<p>Very often, project managers face a difficult organizational environment. The organization lacks the processes to do project management right and the executives don't know how to play their role correctly. In these situations, the PMs need best practices that allow them to do things effectively even though executives and the organization's processes are obstacles rather than assets. The project planning checklist below will help.</p>
<p>The intent of this intense project planning process is to make all of the decisions before we start work. That approach of making the plan and then executing it is much more efficient than a "plan as you go" process for projects. It is also difficult or impossible in many organizations. For this approach to work, the organization, its executives and the project managers must all do things correctly. That is, the executives must specify exactly what they want the project to deliver. They cannot make the project assignment in vague generalities where the only thing that is specific is the due date. The organization must have processes for evaluating and prioritizing projects and giving them access to resources based on those priorities. Last, the project managers must know how to do top-down project planning where they are able to take the clear acceptance criteria, specified by the executive, and decompose it down to the level of specific assignments for each team member. Most organizations fail to meet one or more of these criteria which is why the project planning ideal is so rarely achieved.</p>
