<p><strong>MODEL PRIVACY POLICY</strong></p>
<p><em>Disclaimer concerning the Use of this  Model Policy: This model policy is a suggested format</em><br />
  <em>with suggested text that Texas  REALTORS® may use as a guide to develop an office policy</em><br />
  <em>related to maintaining customers’  personal information private. The Texas Association of</em><br />
  <em>REALTORS® does not represent or  warrant that this model policy addresses all items that</em><br />
  <em>should be addressed in an office  policy or that compliance with this model policy will eliminate</em><br />
  <em>any potential responsibility or  liability by the company or its agents.</em></p>
<p><em>Summary of Applicable Law</em></p>
<p><em>When adopting a privacy policy one  should consider the following rules and statutes:</em><br />
  <em>(a) the Fair and Accurate Credit  Transactions Act of 2003 and the FTC rules adopted under</em><br />
  <em>that Act (16 CFR 682); and</em><br />
  <em>(b) Sections 35.48, 35.581, and 35.62,  Business and Commerce Code.</em></p>
<p><em>Texas Business and Commerce Code  Section 35.581 requires you to adopt a privacy policy if</em><br />
  <em>you require a person to disclose a  social security number in order to provide goods or services</em><br />
  <em>to that person. You should maintain  the confidentiality and security of a social security number</em><br />
  <em>you have obtained. You may want to  maintain the privacy policy in a location that is easily</em><br />
  <em>accessible for agents to provide to  customers and clients upon request, such as a company</em><br />
  <em>website. You do not have to provide a  copy of the policy every time you obtain personal</em><br />
  <em>information. Instead, you must make it  available to any such person upon request.</em></p>
<p><em>When drafting your privacy policy five  main questions need to be answered.</em><br />
  <em>1. How is personal information  collected?</em><br />
  <em>2. How and when is the personal  information used?</em><br />
  <em>3. How is the personal information  protected?</em><br />
  <em>4. Who has access to the personal  information?</em><br />
  <em>5. How is the personal information  disposed?</em></p>
<p><em>Federal and state law requires  businesses to implement proper procedures for the disposal of</em><br />
  <em>personal information the business  maintains in its records. The law requires the business to</em><br />
  <em>take reasonable measures to protect  against unauthorized access. Reasonable measures</em><br />
  <em>include shredding, erasing,  pulverizing, and other types of destruction. Mere deletion of</em><br />
  <em>electronic records is not sufficient.  The destruction of electronic records must render the</em><br />
  <em>electronic records “unreadable or  undecipherable.”</em></p>
<p><em>A business is also required to delete  any electronic record that was established when the</em><br />
  <em>customer issued a bad check which is  later found to be in error. The law applies to any</em><br />
  <em>business that accepts checks.</em></p>
<p><em>Below are model answers to the above  questions that you may include in your privacy policy.</em><br />
  <em>Generally, property managers are more  likely to require and retain personal information than</em><br />
  <em>most other types of real estate  licensees, but any real estate office in Texas should give</em><br />
  <em>consideration to adopting a privacy  policy. You may change the text of the policy to apply to</em><br />
  <em>your particular practices and  procedures.</em></p>

  check, the company will promptly delete the record after  the company and consumer agree<br />
