<p> <strong>December 20, 2010 - </strong>NAHB remodelers around the country say   that figuring out how to explain to their customers why they should pay   the additional costs that come with compliance with the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/" target="_blank">U.S. Environmental Protection Agency</a>'s <a href="http://www.epa.gov/lead/pubs/renovation.htm" target="_blank">Lead: Renovation, Repair and Painting</a> rule is raising more concerns than the required lead-safe work practices themselves.</p>
<p>Few   prospective customers know about the rule, remodelers are reporting,   and some of them even ask if they can just forget about complying with   the federal mandate.</p>
<p>Breaking the law can lead to fines of up to   $38,000 per day for the remodeling company - so that's not an option,   these remodelers say. Instead, it's up to them to explain the importance   of the lead paint rule without scaring the client into deciding against   a remodeling job - or worse yet, finding an uncertified contractor.</p>
<p>A few remodelers shared their techniques for selling home remodeling under the lead rule.</p>
<p><strong>Incorporating the Rule Into Your Sales</strong></p>
<p>"I   really think the best way we are handling the situation is to not get   excited about the rule when we are visiting with our clients," said Mike   Davis, <a href="http://www.nahb.org/page.aspx/category/sectionID=685" target="_blank">CGR</a>, <a href="http://www.nahb.org/page.aspx/category/sectionID=686" target="_blank">CAPS</a>, <a href="http://www.nahb.org/page.aspx/category/sectionID=1174" target="_blank">CGP</a>, with <a href="http://www.tmtconst.com/" target="_blank">TMT Home Remodelers</a> in Redmond, Ore. "I just treat this like any other part of the sales   process. We talk about why the rule exists and why we have to follow the   rule. So far, nobody has balked about the process, only the price."</p>
<p>With   this approach, remodelers can incorporate an explanation of the rule   and its requirements into their first conversations with the customer.   Testing for lead can become part of the home assessment, and the costs   of compliance are included in the estimate if the home tests positive   for lead or was built before 1978.</p>
<p>"I ask a series of questions   that incorporate the lead rule into the conversation with the potential   customer," said Bill Shaw, CGR, CAPS, CGP, of <a href="http://www.wmshawandassoc.com/" target="_blank">William Shaw &amp; Associates</a> in Houston. "I imply that all the contractors they are meeting with should understand and follow the rule."</p>
<p>Shaw   explains what the rule entails and the consequences of not following it   - such as problems with selling the home or exposing children to lead   paint. "The point is to make it a discussion and present myself as a   knowledgeable professional," said Shaw.</p>
<p>Remodelers may also want   to leave some information with the prospective clients by sharing EPA   materials or creating their own. On its website, the EPA has <a href="http://www.epa.gov/opptintr/lead/pubs/leadinfo.htm" target="_blank">information for consumers about the dangers of lead</a>. Remodelers are required under the rule to give their prospective customers a copy of the EPA's <a href="http://www.epa.gov/opptintr/lead/pubs/renovaterightbrochure.pdf" target="_blank">"Renovate Right" pamphlet</a>, which explains the rule and its requirements to consumers. The EPA also provides a <a href="http://www.epa.gov/opptintr/lead/pubs/consumersell.pdf" target="_blank">fact sheet for consumers on the importance of hiring an EPA certified lead-safe renovator</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Selling Lead Testing</strong></p>
<p>Like   other NAHB members in the remodeling industry, Gary Case is frustrated   by the EPA's new requirements for contractors working in homes built   before 1978.</p>
<p>After years of proposals, lawsuits, countersuits and testimony, "nobody is solving this problem," said Case, owner of <a href="http://www.signaturekab.net/" target="_blank">Signature Kitchens and Baths</a> in Rockville, Md. "We may come in and replace the kitchen and do so in   compliance with the law, but if there is lead somewhere else in the   house, we certainly haven't removed it."</p>
<p>Signature's approach is   to convince prospective customers who live in pre-1978 homes to first   have the testing done by a local company that will test every room for a   total charge of $750. </p>
<p>"If there is no lead in the house, the   customer knows - he gets a certificate, and then if he does the work   with us we reduce the contract price by $750." That's an incentive for   the customer to go with Signature and also reflects the cost savings of   not having to use lead-safe work practices, he said.</p>
<p>If the house   does contain lead, the testing reveals exactly where it is. It can then   be removed, perhaps by Signature, and then be retested and certified as   being lead-free. "The customer is ahead of the game, and that's a better   deal than not knowing," Case said. </p>
<p><strong>Overcoming Cost Fears</strong></p>
<p>Remodelers   can use a few different tactics to overcome customer anxiety about the   increased costs of remodeling stemming from the lead rule. One method is   to explain that no matter the costs, remodelers must follow the law.   The EPA created the rule, and its requirements must be followed or a   remodeler could be fined for failing to comply.</p>
<p>Another tactic is   to explain the health and safety benefits of the regulation. The rule   was created to better protect home owners and their families from lead   exposure and potential poisoning. The extra effort it takes to contain   the lead, work safely, and clean up after a project may well be worth   the cost of saving a family member from ill health and other   irreversible consequences of lead poisoning.</p>
<p>When speaking with prospective clients, Scott Reach, CGR, CAPS, CGP, with <a href="http://www.scottreachbuilders.com/" target="_blank">Scott Reach Builders</a> in Houston, explains both the legal requirements and health and safety   advantages of hiring a lead-safe certified renovator. He also emphasizes   the value his professional work brings by leaving a home clean and   dust-free - at least where the work was done. </p>
<p>"Lead is   dangerous," he said, "and our company is certified to work clean and   effectively to protect families. The rule raises the bar for remodeling   and we see this as an opportunity to emphasize our professionalism and   commitment to quality service." </p>
<p>Reach finds that cost issues fade   in the face of these messages about legal responsibility, health and   safety, and the professionalism and quality of the remodeling work.   "We've gotten feedback from clients that they like how we work clean and   contain the area to keep the dust down." The conversation ultimately   comes down to explaining the benefits of hiring a lead-safe professional   remodeler to the customer.</p>
<p><strong>Weeding Out Non-Compliant Contractors</strong></p>
<p>Professional   remodelers continue to struggle with shady contractors who are not   certified and do not plan to follow the requirements of the lead rule.   These professionals are using the EPA's certified lead-safe firm logo in   all promotional and marketing materials to establish their credibility   and knowledge.</p>
<p>Dan Bawden, CGR, <a href="http://www.nahb.org/page.aspx/category/sectionID=684" target="_blank">GMB</a>, CAPS, CGP, with <a href="http://www.legaleaglecontractors.com/" target="_blank">Legal Eagle Contractors</a> in Bellaire, Texas, gives prospective clients a <a href="http://legaleaglecontractors.com/ChooseWisely/" target="_blank">contractor screening test</a> with qualifying questions about the lead rule and other professional   remodeling expertise. He has a conversation with a customer explaining   his qualifications, including certified lead-renovator status, and   demonstrates how he can answer all the questions on the screening test.   The prospective customer is then free to call other remodelers and use   the test to compare their credentials with Bawden's.</p>
<p>Similarly, Scott Sevon, <a href="http://www.nahb.org/page.aspx/category/sectionID=1108" target="_blank">GMR</a>, GMB, CGP, CAPS, CGP, with <a href="http://www.mawchicago.com/" target="_blank">Men at Work</a> in Chicago, makes presentations to home owner associations about the   rule, establishing his credibility, expertise and professionalism in the   process and making the case that a certified professional will produce a   better finished home remodel than someone who is untrained and   uninformed.</p>
<p><strong>Educating News Media</strong></p>
<p>One strategy for   raising awareness about the lead regulation has been to educate the news   media about the rule's requirements and costs.</p>
<p>Cindy Knutson-Lycholat, CGR, CAPS, CGP with <a href="http://www.kb2remodelers.com/" target="_blank">Knutson Brothers</a> in East Troy, Wis., said that she frequently writes for local   newspapers and has written about the lead rule. One of her articles   explained the purpose of the lead certification and why it's important   to hire a certified lead renovator for remodeling projects to protect   the health and safety of a home owner's family. </p>
<p>"For our area,   most of the houses we work on are pre-1978," said Knutson-Lycholat. "So   it's important that home owners know about the EPA's lead renovator   certification and hire only certified firms."</p>
<p>Other remodelers,   such as Scott Reach, have been contacting news media and appearing on   radio shows, writing blogs and communicating directly with consumers   through Twitter and Facebook with information about the lead rule. These   activities demonstrate the remodeler's expertise about the lead rule   and safely remodeling pre-1978 homes.</p>
