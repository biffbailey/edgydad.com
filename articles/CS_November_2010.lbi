<p>When I posted links to a couple of articles about the recovery of residential real estate prices, I promised to update my Case-Schiller Index graph for the Dallas area. </p>

<p>Of course, this is a composite of same property sales data over a large region. Great property in a prime neighborhood didn't suffer so much. Abused walkaway foreclosures suffered more.

<p>It's inescapable, however, that two and a half years ago t'he price index was nearly 126 and at the end of 2011 the &quot;same&quot; property sold at a price index of 114. Roughly equivalent to our home prices 8 years ago in 2003.</p>
<p>The effect of the home buyer tax credit is also clear. No so much.</p>
<p>Combine this with reports such as from Standard and Poor's that the &quot;shadow inventory&quot; -- homes with delinquent mortgages or in foreclosure -- may pressure the market for another 4 years and I conclude we're in for some soft prices and a Buyer's market for 2011 and possible 2012 as well. If you are contemplating selling in order to move up, move down or just change neighborhoods, this is no reason to hold back. The<em> moment you make your deal as a Seller, you become a Buyer</em> ready and able to take back from the market anything the market took from you, and maybe more.
