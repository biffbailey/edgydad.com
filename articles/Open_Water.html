<h2>&quot;To become an effective triathlon swimmer means to become proficient at open water swimming.&quot;</h2><h2>
&quot;a lot of beginners spend enormous amounts of time trying to perfect the stroke first, neglecting balance and rotation. The pitfall of this approach is that you may start seeing results in the pool, but the results do not transfer to the open water.&quot;</h2>
<h2>&quot;The water is your friend. You don’t have to fight with   water; just share the same spirit as the water, and it will help you   move.&quot; – Alexander Popov, Olympic Gold Medalist</h2>
<p>Interesting.  Very interesting. A rip in the bond with overpriced, fast and furious, kick-ass masters swim programs.</p>
<p>Open water is smooth and easy. </p>
<p>Open water is balanced and rythmic.</p>
<p>Find your own way in open water, be aware of where you are, what's around you, see where you're going.</p>
<p>Open water is a long swim.</p>
<p>Open water competition is finding your space, then sharing it with others.</p>
<p>Open water is a hour quietly swiming the Arkansas River below Arc du Loc.</p>
<p><strong>6 tips to help you improve your balance in the water</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Keep a neutral head position. Look down (not forward or back towards your feet). </li>
  <li>Maintain a small and continuous (constant) kick. Use the kick in concert with rotation.</li>
  <li>Keep your arms from crossing over to the opposite side. </li>
  <li>Feel your hips on top of the water by engaging your core muscles. </li>
  <li>Add weights to your training program. Focus on core strength and rotational movements. </li>
  <li>Just relax. “The water is your friend. You don’t have to fight   with water; just share the same spirit as the water, and it will help   you move.” – Alexander Popov, Olympic Gold Medalist </li>
